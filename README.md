# CODSOFT-ML INERNSHIP TASK 
Machine Learning Internship Project-Tasks compeleted the with help of Google Search ,readed tutorials and Watch videos from youtube 

TASK 1
MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION
Created a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. And
uses a techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines.

TASK 2
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Builded a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Uses a
dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or
legitimate.

TASK 3
CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription based service or business. Use historical customer data, including
features like usage behavior and customer demographics, and try
algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient
Boosting to predict churn.

TASK 4
SPAM SMS DETECTION
Builded an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
Machines to identify spam messages

TASK 5
HANDWRITTEN TEXT GENERATION
Implement a character-level recurrent neural network (RNN) to
generate handwritten-like text. Train the model on a dataset of
handwritten text examples, and let it generate new text based on
the learned patterns.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPRTUNITY LOOKING FORWARD TO WORK WITH  THE TEAM WITH NEW PROJECTS 
THANKU ONCE AGAIN FOR THE EFFORT AND RESPONSE FROM CODESOFT TEAM LEADER SIR
